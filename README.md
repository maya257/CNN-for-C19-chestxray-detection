# Covid-19 Detection from Chest X-Rays using CNN
> Covid 19 detection from chest x-ray using Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction
Identifying covid through chest x-rays

## Dataset
### Getting the dataset
> I added the dataset used in this project in a zip file in case links below were broken for any reason. However, I recommend you install `git-lfs` in your workflow since it is a large file (1.15gb). [Learn more about LFS here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files)


- Can get the dataset used in my implementation here: [Dataset](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkGrCMoO9SmmjeJP0ph634H-GGWpyQ?e=MmZAMp)

- You can get latest version of dataset on Kaggle. [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

- If you want images to create you own dataset:
    - Can get Pneumonia Chest x-ray data (images) (This would be images you'd see in viral directory of dataset file) here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
    - You can probably get some C-19 x-ray images from this site: sirm.org
    -You can also get normal data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
